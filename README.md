CS 310 Final Project

spotify analyzer that takes in a user, and performs several analyses

1. prints out information about the user (top artists, top tracks using get_users top items)
2. analyzes the genres, popularity of the person's taste (using get_users_top_items) (for computation requirement)
3. creates a recommendation playlist of x songs with optional artist y or genre z (using get_recommendations)

to consider: how would aws be used? what sort of client?
