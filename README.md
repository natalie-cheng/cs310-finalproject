CS 310 Final Project

Using the SpotifyAPI, we will take in a spotify username and complete three major functions:
1. Retrieve and print user information (top artists, top tracks)
2. Get the users top artists/tracks and extract and analyze the genres and popularity of the person's taste
3. Create a recommended playlist of x songs with optional filters for artist and genre
We will utilize RDS to store the songs recommended when someone requests a playlist, so that if they request another playlist the same songs are not re-recommended.
